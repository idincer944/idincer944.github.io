									<span class="image main"><img src="images/about_me.jpg" alt=""  max-width="200"/></span>
									<p>I'm a backend web developer with a keen interest in Javascript. I believe in the power of technology to revolutionize user experiences and reshape the digital landscape. Through web development, we have the ability to craft immersive and dynamic online platforms that seamlessly connect people, provide information, and offer services. By pushing the boundaries of design and functionality, we can create web experiences that not only meet users' needs but also delight and inspire them. With each line of code, we have the opportunity to make the internet more accessible, engaging, and user-centric, ultimately enriching the way we interact with information and each other in the virtual realm.</p> 
									<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy making music. I'm also a musician and a teacher. I play and teach piano and trombone.</p>
